This is the Portable Windows Chat Application developed for [devaffair](http://github.com/devaffair) .  Designed to be used internall by NBCC Students by the Information Technology Programmer Analyst 1st years.

## New Features!
  - Ability to send confirmation email to newly registered users
  - Log files
  - User logon files

### NOTE:

This project is still a work in progress, do not expect all aspects to be perfect.  But it does work!  And the code is open source. :)

## Why github?
Why not? We're building programs together using stored procedures to ensure the most secure communication on the databse side, why not make it Open Source!

## What's with the Class files?
I wasn't totally satisfied with just slamming code into Visual studio button clicks.  So what better way to communicate than with static and standardized class files!

You'll find amazingly fun-to-write code like:
```CSharp
string body = "<HTML>" +
               "<BODY>" +
               "<h1>Hello!</h1>" +
               "<p>You're all ready to login!  You just need to make sure that you use your password to login :)</p>" +
               "<p><b style=\"color: #4286f4;\">Email: " + emailAddr + "</b></p>" +
               "<p><b style=\"color: #4286f4;\">Password: " + passW + "</b></p>" +
               "</BODY></HTML>";
               //it's pretty.
```
See that?  it's even commented very funky like!
